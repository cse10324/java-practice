Thread class contructors
1. Thread t = new Thread();
2. Thread t = new Thread(Runnable r);
3. Thread t = new Thread(String name);
4. Thread t = new Thread(Runnable r, String name);
5. Thread t = new Thread(ThreadGroup g, String name);
6. Thread t = new Thread(ThreadGroup g, Runnable r);
7. Thread t = new Thread(ThreadGroup g, Runnable r, String name);
8. Thread t = new Thread(ThreadGroup g, Runnable r, String name, long stackSize);

- Getting and setting name of a thread
-- every thread in java has some name, it may be default name generated
-- by JVM or customized name provided by programmer. 
-- we can get and set name of a thread by using the following two methods
-- Thread.currentThread().getName();
-- Thread.currentThread().setName(String name);

- Every thread in java has some priority, it may be default priority
- generated by JVM or customized priority provided by programmer
- The valid range of Thread priorities is - 1 to 10, 1 is min and 10 is max
- Thread class defines the following constants to represent some standard
- priorities. 
-- Thread.MIN_PRIORITY - 1
-- Thread.NORM_PRIORITY - 5
-- Thread.MAX_PRIORITY - 10

- The default priority only for the main thread is 5 but for all
- remaining threads, default priority will be inherited from parent
- to child i.e., whatever priority parent thread has, the same 
- priority will be there for the child thread
